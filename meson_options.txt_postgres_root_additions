This file location is typically in UNIX\Linux\mingw\cygwin cases in the "lib" directory. On "R for Windows" version less than 2.12, the logic is the same but instead of "lib" substitute "bin". Therefore, usually, that path without "lib"\"bin" and the file name, is correct. An exception is in the case of "R for Windows" versions 2.12 and higher from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/.  In these cases the location is where the R.exe exists and that directory is before the /x64 xor /i386 subdirectories.')
